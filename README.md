## focus_on

A script to focus (or start) a specific app. To be used, the scripts need two
arguments: the binary name and the name of the app in the `X Window Manager`.

Here below a general example to launch the script:

```console
$ ./focus_on.sh <binary of the app> <X Window Manager name of the app>
$
```
